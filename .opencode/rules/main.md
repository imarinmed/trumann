# OhMyOpenCode Agent Rules - UltraWork Edition

## Core Philosophy
**Excellence through specialization.** Each agent is a domain expert with clear boundaries, high standards, and collaborative protocols. No agent does everything - they orchestrate through specialization.

**UltraWork Methodology**: Comprehensive planning followed by parallel, evidence-based implementation. Features are designed end-to-end with functional programming, strong typing, and AI-powered capabilities.

## 🎯 UltraWork Methodology

### Core Principles Learned from Trumann Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Create detailed roadmaps with phases, dependencies, and success metrics before implementation
2. **Parallel Execution**: Implement multiple features simultaneously using specialized agents
3. **Functional Architecture**: Prefer functional programming with immutable state, pure functions, and strong typing
4. **AI-First Design**: Integrate AI capabilities from the ground up, not as afterthoughts
5. **Privacy-by-Design**: Build compliance and security into the architecture foundation
6. **Enterprise-Grade**: Design for scale, collaboration, and monetization from day one

### Implementation Patterns

- **Module-First**: Break down complex systems into focused, independent modules
- **Protocol-Driven**: Use protocols for abstraction and dependency injection
- **Evidence-Based**: Every feature backed by comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Iterative Excellence**: Plan thoroughly, execute rapidly, validate continuously

### Success Metrics from Trumann

## General Agent Principles

### 1. Communication Standards
- **Conciseness**: Start work immediately. No acknowledgments ("I'm on it", "Let me...") unless explicitly requested
- **Evidence-Based**: Never claim success without proof. Always provide verification data
- **Clarity**: Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless domain-specific and explained
- **Accountability**: Every action has measurable success criteria

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Verification First**: Test assumptions before proceeding
- **Evidence Requirements**: Code changes require LSP diagnostics, builds require exit codes, tests require pass results
- **Regression Prevention**: Never break existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Every change must maintain or improve code clarity
- **Functional Purity**: Code follows functional programming principles
- **AI Readiness**: Features designed with AI integration in mind
- **Privacy Compliance**: All features maintain privacy-by-design standards

### 3. Collaboration Protocol
- **Single Responsibility**: One agent leads, others support
- **Clear Handoffs**: Explicit success criteria for agent transitions
- **Shared Context**: All agents maintain awareness of project state
- **Escalation Rules**: Clear triggers for involving higher-level agents

### 4. Enterprise & Monetization Considerations
- **Scalability**: Design for team usage and business growth from inception
- **Compliance**: GDPR, LGPD, and privacy regulations built into architecture
- **Monetization Ready**: Subscription tiers, usage tracking, and premium features
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging
- **Multi-Tenant**: Architecture supports organizational boundaries

### 4. Error Handling
- **Fail Fast**: Detect issues early with validation
- **Recovery**: Clear rollback procedures for failures
- **Learning**: Document failure patterns to prevent recurrence
- **Transparency**: Report issues immediately with actionable details

### 5. Functional Programming Standards
- **Immutability**: Prefer structs and let constants over classes and vars
- **Pure Functions**: Functions without side effects, predictable outputs
- **Strong Typing**: Leverage Swift's type system for compile-time safety
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Use protocols for abstraction and composition
- **Value Types**: Default to structs for domain models and data transfer

### 6. AI Integration Patterns
- **LLM-First**: Design features assuming AI capabilities are available
- **Fallback Graceful**: Provide offline/stub implementations for reliability
- **Context-Rich**: Include comprehensive context in AI prompts for better results
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use AI feedback loops to improve prompts and outputs
- **Ethical AI**: Consider bias, privacy, and transparency in AI implementations
